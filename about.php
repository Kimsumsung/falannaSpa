                        <p class="lead">We are children of the North, the former kingdom of Lanna. We appreciate our arts and culture and love nature: our rice paddies and the mountains. We enjoy seeing people happy, their faces adorned with beautiful smiles. All this contributed to something that we built with love.  It is called Fah Lanna Spa.<br><br>  
                            Fah Lanna is owned and managed by a group of friends who love what they do and have a passion for their local culture and arts. We enjoy providing a high level of customer service at affordable prices to make it possible for anyone to enjoy the century old Thai massage and other body treatments.<br><br> 

                            We always want to remain a family business with a heart, putting the wellbeing of our staff and customers first. While a business has to be profitable, our aim is to for our staff to love their work and be happy to come to work because we believe that if they are happy, they will make our customers happy.<br><br> 

                            <address><h3>Our two Location:</h3>

                                We have two locations in Chiang Mai city: <b>Fah Lanna Spa </b>inside the moat, in the old city of Wiang Kaew road and the smaller Fah Lanna Massage Shop is by <b>the night bazaar.</b> These two great locations and the difference in our price structure for these two very different shops allow our customers to choose the experience they desire, on any kind of budget. <br><br>

                                The bigger and more luxurious spa offers a complimentary pick up service and we also drop you back off after you have finished your pampering session, all free of charge. As you step over the bridge into our spa, you are immediately transported into the calm and welcoming atmosphere. You can sit, relax and enjoy the magnificent view down our fish pond while enjoying a refreshing herbal drink while doing the consultation for your body treatment or massage.<br><br>
                                Our facilities include the unique herbal steam cave for a steam bath, a hair and beauty salon, single and couple rooms with Jaccuzi bath, en suite bathrooms and showers for all rooms, signature treatments like Reiki Healing, Tok Sen Massage (only found in Chiang Mai) and much more.<br><br>

                                Our smaller brother is the Massage Shop by the night bazaar. It’s located only 150 m away from the central intersection at the night bazaar, down the small alley between Burger King and McDonald’s (opposide the Le Meridien hotel). The Massage Shop has one Thai Massage room with four beds and two private single rooms. There is one bathroom with shower to use for our customers. While we offer almost the same range of massages, body treatments and packages as in the spa, the prices are much lower and reflect regular massage shop prices. As it’s a small shop, there is less privacy and it can be difficult to accommodate larger groups. Waiting times may occur as it is a very popular location. There is no pick up service available for the Massage Shop.<br>

                            <h3>Supporting charitable causes</h3>

                            We support a number of good causes that are close to our heart.<br><br> 

                            Build a School Project<br>
                            We are very proud to support this project and to be able to contribute to the construction of a new school building in a small and remote hill tribe village in Mae Hong Son province about 4 hours west of Chiang Mai. So far we have supported the construction of a new school building as the old building was no longer safe and not sanitary. We continue the support of this school and the whole community with supplies of educational materials and facilities. Since the construction of the new building, a second water tank has been installed at the school (there is no running water in the village but mountain water is harvested), a solar panel has been installed (there is no electricity in the village), books have been donated and we helped with the donation and distribution of hundreds of blankets and clothes for the children and adults in the surrounding area.<br><br> 

                            Elephant Nature Park & Bring the Elephant Home Foundation 
                            A sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants located about an hour away from Chiang Mai in Mae Taeng that really gives you a wonderful experience. Lek and her team rescue mistreated or old Elephants and give them a natural home in the park, where they don't have to perform or work but can just be free animals. It's possible to stay here overnight and to volunteer. We highly recommend that if you want to experience Thai Elephants, you should go here and nowhere else!<br><br>

                            <a href="www.freetheslaves.net" TARGET="_blank">Free the Slaves </a>
                            Watching the  <U><a href = "http://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_kristine_glimpses_of_modern_day_slavery.html" TARGET="_blank">TED Talk</a></U>  by Lisa Kristine made a lasting impact on us and we very much would like to show our support for the Free the Slaves organisation. In the future, we hope to be able to exhibit Lisa is book on Slavery at our spa and support the Free the Slaves organisation by a donation box. We are working on it!
